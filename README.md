## Building
Project files can be build with CMake for both Linux (GCC) and Windows (MSVC and MinGW).
Even using 64bit OS, Sphere must be compiled/executed in 32bit mode to work properly (included project files already compile it in 32bit mode by default).

### Windows
#### Visual Studio
* Open 'GraySvr.vcxproj' file using Visual Studio (if you're using VS > 2010 it will request an update on project file, just click OK to update)
* On top menu, select the build configuration (Debug/Local/Nightly/Release) and click on 'Build > Build Solution' to compile

#### CMake
You can compile using provided CMake files.

### Linux
* Open the terminal on sphere source dir and use the command "makefile NIGHTLY=1 -f makefile" to compile using GCC.

Some libs are required to compile/execute Sphere on Linux. You can install them using these commands:

#### Ubuntu
* sudo apt-get install libmysqld-dev
* sudo apt-get install libmysql++ libmysql++-dev
* sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev:i386

#### CentOS 7
* yum install mysql mysql-libs mysql-devel
* yum install mysql-community-libs-compat.i686
* yum install glibc-devel.i686

## Coding notes for new contributors
* Make sure you can compile and run the program before pushing a commit.
* Rebasing instead of pulling the project is a better practice to avoid unnecessary "merge branch master" commits.
* Removing/Changing/Adding anything that was working in one way for years should be followed by an ini setting if the changes cannot be replicated from script to keep some backwards compatibility.
